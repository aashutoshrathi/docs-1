          In the zkEVM framework, the EVM is treated as a computational unit.
          zkEVM executes the EVM and produces zero-knowledge proofs to validate
          their execution. The private transactions and the current state of the
          Ethereum blockchain are the inputs to the EVM computation.
          Consequently, zkEVM produces both the result of the computation
          through the EVM and a zero-knowledge proof confirming the validity of
          the execution.

          In contrast, the Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine (zkVM) is a versatile
          virtual machine engineered to facilitate zero-knowledge proofs across
          diverse computational tasks. zkVM executes computations and creates a
          ZKP to prove the validity of their execution and the generated result.{' '}

          Unlike zkEVM, zkVM seamlessly integrates with various computations.
          Developers can harness zkVM's framework to create and execute
          zero-knowledge applications, irrespective of the underlying blockchain
          network. This adaptability broadens its utility beyond financial and
          privacy-oriented use cases. zkVM finds application in various domains,
          such as supply chain management, healthcare, and the entertainment
          industry, where preserving data integrity is imperative.
