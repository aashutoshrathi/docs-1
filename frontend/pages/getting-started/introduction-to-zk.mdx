# Introduction to ZK

To get started within ZKM, let's explore the basics of ZK Proofs

## In Summary

- A Prover generates a SNARK Proof which proves correctness and (if intended) privacy of the computation.
  - **S**uccinct - short in size
  - **N**on-interactive - Verifier does not need to interact with the Prover to Verify the Proof
  - **AR**gument - "Proof"
  - **K**nowledge
- Properties of a SNARK:
  - **Completeness** - If both parties are honest, the protocol gives the correct result
  - **Soundness** - If the Prover is trying to cheat, the Verifier will accept with negligible probability
  - **Succinctness** - The proof is short AND verification is easy
  - **Privacy (Optional)** - The protocol does not leak useful information to the Verifier
- How a zkRollup works:
  - Outsource all expensive computations off Ethereum to a Layer 2
  - Send the results with a proof (SNARK) to Layer 1
